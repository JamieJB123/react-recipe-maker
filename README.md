## Overview:

This project was built as part of my ongoing learning: specifically learning how to build React applications. This was built using React and Vite for quick project set up.

Throughout the course of the project, I learned how to:

1. Use Event Listeners in React
2. How to use and manage State in React and how to work with state across the Component tree.
3. Conditional rendering based on State and other factors in React.
4. How to handle forms using React action functions.
5. Different state management strategies.
6. How to integrate an AI model using API calls to dynamically generate content on the application.
7. How to use third-party react packages (such as react-markdown) to perform certain operations.

## Project:

The project is an AI augmented recipe maker app.

User's can input ingredients which they have around the house and click 'Get a recipe'. The ingredients which they have inputted will then be passed to an AI model through an API call and a suggested recipe for those ingredients will be displayed to the user.

The application makes use of a clean and minimal design.

## AI API Integration:

For making API calls to an AI model, I used [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/). Hugging Face is a platform which provides tools for building AI augmented applications among other things.

At this stage, this is a pure front-end React project and does not have a back-end for storing the API key. It is fully functional on my local environment when the project has access to my API key.

## Tools:

- React
- Vite
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- react-maker
- Hugging Face
- Git + GitHub
